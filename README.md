# House-Sales-Prediction

Predicting the price of the House

Data collected from kaggle

Steps involved :

1) EDA through Visualization

2) Data Cleaning

3) Feature Engineering : 

    a) Extracted Hidden features from the date variable
    
    b) Sorted and Mapped data based on the geographical features like zipcodes
    
4) Train/Test Split

5) Scaling to avoid dominance of one variable over other variables

6) Created a Sequential Model through TF2 Keras API

7) Evaluating on the new test data
